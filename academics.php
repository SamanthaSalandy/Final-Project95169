						Engineering is the use of scientific principles to design and build machines, structures, and other items, including bridges, tunnels, roads, vehicles, and buildings. The discipline of engineering encompasses a broad range of more specialized fields of engineering, each with a more specific emphasis on particular areas of applied mathematics, applied science, and types of application.

							Engineering is a lot of fun and we promise you wont cry while trying to learn the steps and currency of engineering.
							essential for current job market. Curriculum has recently been revisited to align it with Outcome Based Education (OBE) system, necessary requirements of Washington Accord (WA). Because of the initiative of PEC, Pakistan is a full signatory of WA, which means substantial equivalence of engineering qualiﬁcations among the signatory countries and cross mobility of engineers in International market. The focus of our engineering education henceforth would be to improve the soft skills and conﬁdence level of graduate and to encourage them to emerge as entrepreneur’s able to generate wealth.

							Coding is fun or at least it can be when it isnt stressing you out and making you want to pull out your hair. Do not worry we also offer counseling after you hopefully pass this course. Possibly you may instead choose animation and you may like it but that one is not easy either. Have fun deciding.
